He can talk you into making something immoral keen to the intellect. Today, we are reaping, as each generation does, that portion of knowledge which was sown early in the dawn of history, and as it ripens and falls into the minds of young and old everywhere, we shall accordingly stand or fall by our decisions.

This is not cultism based on an irreverent spirituality. It is cultism rooted in police state spirituality. Additionally, demonic agents can masquerade as pious religious authorities. They are there to enter in the doors of churches and tarnish the foundations and cornerstones of any religious organization. The demonic agent is deviously cunning and tantalizes the intellect.

You may not like how it is delivered, you may not agree, but to erase those you don\u2019t agree with is nothing more than a social media suicide solution. On tonight's show, Clyde Lewis talks with the founder of Infowars.com, Alex Jones about MARGINAL BEHAVIOR - SOCIAL MEDIA\u2019S SUICIDE SOLUTION",

Without the ability to examine an issue impartially and completely, there is little hope of maintaining liberty and freedom, as history repeatedly demonstrates.

                "description": "It wasn\u2019t that history was repeating itself in 2017 \u2013 it was trying to erase itself \u2013 like someone wanted to reverse engineer the year. Before everyone decides they want to do 2017 over again, researchers have used a mixture of chloroform and acetone to create conditions where for some purposes, time actually appears to move backwards. If it could be done all over again, reverse engineering of the year, I would hope that we would look back on all of the things that we once thought were science fiction and marvel at how we may even get that flying car after all. On tonight's show, Clyde Lewis talks with Reverse Speech pioneer, David John Oates about 2017 - REVERSE ENGINEER THE OLD YEAR W/ DAVID JOHN OATES",

New capabilities, rekindled dreams and an atmosphere of entrepreneurialism mean a new wave of terrestrial tech has forged a well-worn path that will yield profits for science, industry, and military occupation. Space travel is moving from the world of government procurement and aerospace engineering giants to venture capital-funded start-ups that rely on ever-cheaper services for more customers.

                "description": "\n            \t\n                <p>Soap Box is the podcast series we do here at Risky.Biz where we have detailed discussions with vendors about all sorts of stuff \u2013 sometimes it\u2019s about their products, other times it\u2019s about the landscape as they see it, other times it\u2019s about research they\u2019ve done that they want to promote. Soap Box is a wholly sponsored podcast series \u2013 just so you know \u2013 so everyone you hear on it, paid to be on it.</p>\n\n<p>And this Soap Box edition is brought to you by\u00a0Respond\u00a0Software. We\u2019ll be joined by\u00a0Respond\u00a0Software\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Mike Armistead to talk about\u00a0Respond\u2019s tech. Mike has an interesting history in infosec\u2026 he actually co-founded Fortify, the software\u00a0security firm, before winding up at HPE as the VP and General Manager for Arcsight, the poor fella. But he\u2019s free now! Freeeeeee! And he\u2019s co-founded the venture we\u2019re talking about today.</p>\n\n<p>So, what\u2019s the idea behind\u00a0Respond Software? Well, to break it down into really simple terms the whole idea is to take all the zillions of events your existing security kit flags and distill them down into meaningful alerts. To put this into context, Mike says that during the 30 days in the lead up to the interview we recorded, his customers fed two billion events into their\u00a0Respond\u00a0Software\u00a0gear. Of those two billion events,\u00a0Respond\u00a0deemed 7 million of them worthy of escalation, and from there determined 45,000 were malicious, but then\u2026 and this is the cool part, this only resulted in 350 incidents raised by the Respond\u00a0platform. From 2 billion to 350.</p>\n\n<p>So it\u2019s a great idea \u2013 tune out the crap and look at meaningful correlations. Automate the decision making around what\u2019s serious and what\u2019s not. You\u2019ve got all this gear, maybe you\u2019ve got something aggregating it, but what\u2019s applying decision logic to it?</p>\n\n<p>Mike sent me a list of\u00a0software\u00a0Respond\u00a0currently supports: all manner of IDSes, AV and EDR suites and then other stuff that gives their\u00a0software\u00a0the context it needs to make better decisions, like active directory, Nessus, Qualys, Splunk, QRadar\u2026 whatever! The idea is, plug ALL your over-alerting crap into\u00a0Respond Software\u2019s gear and it\u2019ll do a good enough job of correlating events that you\u2019ll only have to deal with what\u2019s real. Well, that\u2019s the pitch. Mike Armistead joined me to to flesh it out a bit more.</p>\n\n                \n                \n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Show notes</h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                        <dl>\n                        \n                          <dt><a href=\"https://respond-software.com/\">Emulating the decision-making of an expert security analyst | Respond Software\n</a></dt>\n                          <dd></dd>\n                        \n                        </dl>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                \n                \n            ",

Alex also served as the CSO at Yahoo for a time, but his security career stretches back a long way. He co-founded iSEC Partners back in 2004, and before that he did some time with @Stake.</p>\n\n<p>The @Stake mafia is everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>These days Alex is an adjunct professor at Stanford University. He joined me to talk about the week\u2019s security news, as well as to have a chat about the Edward Snowden disclosures, five years on.</p>\n\n<p>This week\u2019s show is brought to you by Thinkst Canary, big thanks to them for that. And instead of one of their staff being on the show this week in the sponsor chair, they asked me to interview this week\u2019s sponsor guest, their customer, Mike Ruth, a security engineer with Cruise Automation.</p>\n\n<p>Mike did a presentation at a conference called QCon recently all about automating the deployment of canary tokens at scale using some nifty CI/CD tricks. He\u2019ll be joining us after the news to tell us all about that.</p>\n\n<p>Items discussed in this week\u2019s news:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>NSO Group busted to selling to Saudi Arabia</li>\n  <li>NSO malware targets Mexican journalists</li>\n  <li>Edward Snowden claims NSO connection in Khashoggi case</li>\n  <li>Australia\u2019s AA Bill latest</li>\n  <li>npm supply-chain attack targets Bitcoiners</li>\n  <li>Guardian reports Manafort met Assange, denials, lawsuits flying already</li>\n  <li>UK parliament seizes Facebook documents</li>\n  <li>Uber fined over 2016 breach coverup</li>\n  <li>UK cops decline to charge bug reporter</li>\n  <li>USPS finally fixes data exposure after Krebs intervention</li>\n  <li>Rowhammer attack bypasses ECC protections</li>\n  <li>Bloomberg is investigating its own reporting on Supermicro</li>\n  <li>Magecart is everywhere</li>\n  <li>Google, Mozilla plan browser access to file systems</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Links to everything that we discussed are below and you can follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/riskybusiness\">Patrick</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alexstamos\">Alex</a> on Twitter if that\u2019s your thing.</p>\n\n                \n                \n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Show notes</h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                        <dl>\n                        \n                          <dt><a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-hacking-firm-nso-group-offered-saudis-cellphone-spy-tools-report/\">Israeli hacking firm NSO Group offered Saudis cellphone spy tools - report | The Times of Israel</a></dt>\n                          <dd></dd>\n                        \n                          <dt><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com.au/edward-snowden-israeli-spyware-nso-group-pegasus-jamal-khashoggi-murder-2018-11?r=US&IR=T\">Edward Snowden: Israeli spyware was used to track and eventually kill Jamal Khashoggi | Business Insider</a></dt>\n                          <dd></dd>\n                        \n                          <dt><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/world/americas/mexico-spyware-journalist.html\">A Journalist Was Killed in Mexico.

                "description": "\n            \t\n                <p>The Soap Box podcast series is a wholly sponsored podcast series we do here at Risky.Biz \u2013 vendors pay to participate. This Soap Box edition is brought to you by AttackIQ.</p>\n\n<p>AttackIQ is a five-year-old company that makes an attack simulation platform. The idea is you agitate a network with suspicious traffic and activities, then measure what the response looks like on the other side. As you\u2019ll hear, Stephan argues this is a better way to test your controls than trying to do it after an incident has been and gone.</p>\n\n<p>Mostly people are using it to verify the effectiveness of their security controls. They already have endpoint security software, IDS, various monitoring bits and pieces, but quite often this stuff just isn\u2019t tuned right. So, you throw some attack traffic and behaviour at your systems and see what bubbles up</p>\n\n<p>One piece of work that has been absolutely vital to AttackIQ\u2019s success is the MITRE ATT&amp;CK Matrix. Like AttackIQ, the ATT&amp;CK Matrix has been around for five years.</p>\n\n<p>Stephan Chenette is AttackIQ\u2019s CTO and he joined me to talk all about how they\u2019re trying to use the ATT&amp;CK Matrix to drive their whole outlook, and, conversely, how they\u2019re spending time talking to MITRE about where the whole thing is going.</p>\n\n                \n                \n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Show notes</h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                        <dl>\n                        \n                          <dt><a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/\">MITRE ATT&amp;CK\u2122</a></dt>\n                          <dd></dd>\n                        \n                          <dt><a href=\"https://www.attackiq.com/\">AttackIQ</a></dt>\n                          <dd></dd>\n                        \n                        </dl>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                \n                \n            ",

The types of bugs being turned up aren\u2019t really a surprise, but the extent to which old software is a problem was actually pretty surprising to him. He knew it was bad, he says, but he didn\u2019t know it\u2019s this bad.</p>\n\n<p>Adam Boileau, as usual, joins the show this week to talk about all the week\u2019s security news:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>More Chinese MSS officers indicted by the US DoJ</li>\n  <li>ASD chief speaks publicly on 5G Huawei ban</li>\n  <li>China playing funny buggers with BGP</li>\n  <li>Russia is still messing with the US during the midterms</li>\n  <li>Facebook boots more Iranian influence pages</li>\n  <li>New privacy features in Signal</li>\n  <li>Plus much, much more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Links to everything that we discussed are below, including the discussions that were edited out.

Stephen will be along later in the show to talk about what they\u2019ve been able to engineer here. I\u2019ve actually been working with them on this (in a limited capacity) for a few months and it\u2019s very interesting stuff.</p>\n\n<p>So yeah he\u2019s talking about a feature release, then he\u2019ll be releasing some open source tooling that mine your network metadata and spot interactive shells in your environment, which is handy, and then he\u2019s going to preview some free training he\u2019s doing with some other very well respected security people in New York soon.</p>\n\n<p>Links to everything that we discussed are below, including the discussions that were edited out.

                "description": "\n            \t\n                <p>The Soap Box podcast series is a wholly sponsored podcast series we do here at Risky.Biz \u2013 vendors pay to participate. This soap box edition is brought to you by Trend Micro.</p>\n\n<p>And in this edition we\u2019re speaking with Dustin Childs who works for the Zero Day Initiative. ZDI is the entity responsible for the pwn2own competition. But not just that \u2013 they\u2019ve been buying bugs since before it was cool. Everything from enterprise software, to linux bugs.. whatever. You find it, they\u2019ll buy it.</p>\n\n<p>Trend Micro actually owns the ZDI, and there\u2019s a story right there in how that came to pass\u2026 but you know what? Trend seems to really be behind the ZDI program.</p>\n\n<p>As you\u2019ll hear, the original idea behind ZDI when it was a TippingPoint thing was so they could write IDS signatures for vulnerabilities that ZDI unearthed. We know today that spinning up sigs for bugs you\u2019re paying for isn\u2019t really a winning strategy for picking up 0day attempts against your computers, so, the question becomes, what do you do with a program like ZDI when you\u2019re Trend Micro?</p>\n\n<p>As it turns out, you do two things with it \u2013 there\u2019s the marketing side, but there\u2019s also the constant stream of exploit submissions that come in handy when you\u2019re making endpoint security software.</p>\n\n<p>We\u2019ll also be hearing from Eric Skinner in this podcast \u2013 he\u2019s Trend\u2019s VP of Solution Marketing at Trend. Trend is pushing a major release of its endpoint security software and he\u2019s along to spruik that a bit, as well as chiming in on some of the ZDI stuff.</p>\n\n\n                \n                \n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Show notes</h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                        <dl>\n                        \n                          <dt><a href=\"https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/\">Zero Day Initiative | Home</a></dt>\n                          <dd></dd>\n                        \n                          <dt><a href=\"https://www.trendmicro.com/en_au/business/products/user-protection/sps/endpoint/detection-response.html\">Endpoint Sensor | Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) |Trend Micro</a></dt>\n                          <dd></dd>\n                        \n                        </dl>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                \n                \n            ",

They showed me photos they said were from a teardown of a supermicro motherboard. These photos showed an unlabelled integrated circuit the source said was likely a hardware back door.</p>\n\n<p>Further, the source said there were other problems with the Supermicro gear, including vulnerable firmware and security functions that just didn\u2019t work properly.</p>\n\n<p>Now the source says the photos were from different equipment, not their teardown of the Supermicro gear, and that they did not find hardware back doors on the Supermicro equipment.</p>\n\n<p>So basically that source\u2019s credibility with me is pretty shot right now, and the best I can do is retract my repetition of the source\u2019s claim that they had verified backdoors in the Supermicro equipment.</p>\n\n                \n                \n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Show notes</h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                        <dl>\n                        \n                          <dt><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies\">The Big Hack: How China Used a Tiny Chip to Infiltrate U.S. Companies - Bloomberg</a></dt>\n                          <dd></dd>\n                        \n                        </dl>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                \n                \n            ",

                "description": "\n            \t\n                <p>Soap Box is the wholly sponsored podcast series we do where vendors pay to participate.</p>\n\n<p>Our guest in this edition is Jerrod Chong, the SVP of product at Yubico, the makers of Yubikeys. We were originally going to publish this Soap Box with Yubico a few weeks ago, but we delayed it for a very good reason.</p>\n\n<p>This podcast is going out at the same time as a press release from Yubico \u2013 they\u2019re releasing the Yubikey 5, and it\u2019s a very significant update.</p>\n\n<p>Regular listeners would have heard me talk about seeing Yubico\u2019s booth at Black Hat \u2013 it was like a mosh pit, and I think there are two reasons for that. Firstly, they were giving away keys, (haha) but secondly, they were demonstrating FIDO2 Windows logins over NFC.</p>\n\n<p>With the launch of the Yubikey 5, Yubico has actually delivered passwordless logins for Windows networks. You can do tap only via NFC, tap and pin via NFC, or you can roll old school with USB.</p>\n\n<p>So, Jerrod Chong joined me for this conversation. We talk about the Yubikey 5, and more broadly about the future of authentication and authentication devices.</p>\n\n                \n                \n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Show notes</h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                        <dl>\n                        \n                          <dt><a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/2018/09/introducing-the-yubikey-5-series-with-new-nfc-and-fido2-passwordless-features/\">Introducing the YubiKey 5 Series with New NFC and FIDO2 Passwordless Features | Yubico</a></dt>\n                          <dd></dd>\n                        \n                          <dt><a href=\"https://www.yubico.com/lightning-project/\">Yubico Lightning Project | Yubico</a></dt>\n                          <dd></dd>\n                        \n                        </dl>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                \n                \n            ",

                "description": "\n            \t\n                <p>We\u2019re going to be talking to two people in this podcast and the topic is, for the most part, the introduction of pointer authentication on the latest Apple iPhones. This is a development that flew under the radar of most of the infosec media and it\u2019s significant because it is going to basically wipe out ROP exploits as we know them. There\u2019s no such thing as a perfect mitigation, but Apple has leveraged some recent ARM features to really lock down their devices.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the pointer authentication suff they\u2019ve also made some changes that will affect the ability of companies like Cellebrite to unlock phones. Again, this won\u2019t kill unlocks completely, but in one release Apple really has made life a lot harder for people in the offence game.</p>\n\n<p>This will eventually have some consequences for the crypto debate. These devices are just getting more and more secure through some really cool engineering.</p>\n\n<p>So we\u2019ll be talking to Chris Wade about this, he\u2019s the brain behind Corellium, an iOS emulator. His clients include everyone from exploit developers to the publishers of very popular iOS applications. If you want to back-test an app change on 15 different versions of iOS Corellium is the way to do that\u2026 or if you want to, you know, test your latest 0day it\u2019s good for that, too.</p>\n\n<p>Then we\u2019re going to hear from Dr. Silvio Cesare of Infosect here in Oz. He\u2019s going to talk about whether we might see similar mitigations on intel and weigh in on Apple\u2019s changes.</p>\n\n                \n                \n                <div class=\"panel panel-default\">\n                    <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n                        <h3 class=\"panel-title\">Show notes</h3>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"panel-body\">\n                        <dl>\n                        \n                          <dt><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/business/site/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdf\">Apple iOS Security Guide</a></dt>\n                          <dd></dd>\n                        \n                        </dl>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                \n                \n            ",
